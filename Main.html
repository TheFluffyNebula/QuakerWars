            A long time ahead in a galaxy not far away...

            An asymmetrical time vortex in Founders has caused one side to progress forward
            and the other remember the old ways. 

            The technologically advanced side of the Frankatrons has developed a new technology called the astrano core 
            that allows them to produce unlimited energy. 
            
            Meanwhile, Kingborough has been developing spells to counteract the astrano core in the Hege Academy for Sorcery.

            Kingborough's fairy authorities are pursuing a cyborg spy as he returns from The Wizards' Commons 
            to inform the Frankatrons of the newest prophecy, one that could alter the war forever...
